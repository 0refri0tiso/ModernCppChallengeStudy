The Easybeats were formed in Sydney in 1964 by five young immigrants from Britain and the Netherlands. They quickly gained a loyal fan base and a reputation for their exciting live performances. They signed with Albert Productions, a label that would later launch the careers of AC/DC and Rose Tattoo. The band's original lineup consisted of Stevie Wright (lead vocals), Harry Vanda (lead guitar), George Young (rhythm guitar), Dick Diamonde (bass), and Snowy Fleet (drums).
 
The band's discography spans from 1965 to 2005, including 13 studio albums, several compilations, and numerous singles. Their music evolved from the early beat and pop influences of the British Invasion to more complex and diverse styles, such as psychedelic rock, hard rock, and glam rock. Some of their later albums, such as Vigil (1968) and Friends (1969), are considered to be among their best and most experimental works.
 
The Easybeats disbanded in 1970, after a series of personal and professional difficulties. However, their legacy lives on through their songs, which have been covered by many artists, such as David Bowie, Bruce Springsteen, The Sex Pistols, and Jet. Their members also continued to be involved in music, with Vanda and Young becoming a successful songwriting and production duo, Wright pursuing a solo career, and Young's younger brothers Malcolm and Angus forming AC/DC.

## The Easybeats: Some Fun Facts
 
The Easybeats were not only a great rock band, but also a fascinating group of people. Here are some fun facts about them that you may not know:
 
- The Easybeats formed around five European migrants. Dutch-born Harry Vanda and Dick Diamonde were living at the Villawood Migrant Hostel when they met 15-year-old English-born Stevie Wright and Scottish-born George Young. Young was the younger brother of Alex (aka George Alexander), who found success in the UK with The Big Six and Grapefruit. The fifth member, Snowy Fleet, was also from England and joined the band after answering an ad in a music store.
- The band's name was inspired by a slogan on a Coca-Cola sign that read "Enjoy Coke - The Easy Beat". They also considered calling themselves The Starfighters, The Blue Jays, and The Music Men.
- The band's first hit, "She's So Fine", was written by Stevie Wright in the shower. He later said: "I was singing in the shower and I came up with 'She's so fine, she's so fine, she's mine all mine'. I ran out of the shower with soap all over me and wrote it down."
- The band's biggest hit, "Friday on My Mind", was written by Harry Vanda and George Young in a dingy basement flat in London. They were frustrated by their lack of success and homesickness, and wanted to capture the feeling of looking forward to the weekend. The song was originally titled "Monday Morning Blues", but their producer Shel Talmy suggested changing it to "Friday on My Mind".
- The band's original drummer, Snowy Fleet, left the band in 1967 to pursue a career in car racing. He was replaced by Tony Cahill, who had previously played with The Purple Hearts and The Missing Links.
- The band's final single, "St. Louis", was banned by some radio stations in Australia for its controversial lyrics. The song was about a young man who leaves his girlfriend in St. Louis to join a hippie commune in San Francisco. The line "And I'm gonna get stoned every night" was considered too explicit for the time.

The Easybeats were a band that broke new ground and made history with their music. They were also a band that had fun and lived life to the fullest. Their discography is a testament to their talent, creativity, and spirit.
